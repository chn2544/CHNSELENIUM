What is TestNG?
TestNG is an automation testing framework in which NG stands for “Next Generation”. TestNG is inspired by JUnit which uses the annotations (@). 

Using TestNG, you can generate a proper report, and you can easily come to know how many test cases are passed, failed, and skipped.
Default Selenium tests do not generate a proper format for the test results. Using TestNG in Selenium, we can generate test results.

Features of TestNG -
-Generate the report in a proper format including a number of test cases runs, the number of test cases passed, the number of test cases failed, and the number of test cases skipped.
-Multiple test cases can be grouped more easily by converting them into testng.xml file. In which you can make priorities which test case should be executed first.
-The same test case can be executed multiple times without loops just by using keyword called ‘invocation count.’
-Using testng, you can execute multiple test cases on multiple browsers, i.e., cross browser testing.
-The TestNG framework can be easily integrated with tools like TestNG Maven, Jenkins, etc.
-Annotations used in the testing are very easy to understand ex: @BeforeMethod, @AfterMethod, @BeforeTest, @AfterTest
-WebDriver has no native mechanism for generating reports. TestNG can generate the report in a readable format like the one shown below.
-TestNG simplifies the way the tests are coded. There is no more need for a static main method in our tests. The sequence of actions is regulated by easy-to-understand annotations that do not require methods to be static.
-Uncaught exceptions are automatically handled by TestNG without terminating the test prematurely. These exceptions are reported as failed steps in the report.

What is Annotation in TestNG?
Annotations in TestNG are lines of code that can control how the method below them will be executed. They are always preceded by the @ symbol.
